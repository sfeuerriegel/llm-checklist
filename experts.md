# Expert panel


Our Expert Panel consists of 68 researchers from different universities and research institutions across the world who collaborated to develop the GUIDE-LLM checklist. The group brings together backgrounds in psychology, political science, economics, sociology, management, communication, and computational social science, alongside specialists in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. This interdisciplinary composition reflects the wide range of fields in which large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied.

The panel includes scholars at different career stages and methodological traditions, combining experience in empirical behavioral research with technical expertise in developing and evaluating language models. The resulting framework should thus reflect broad disciplinary input and supports researchers, reviewers, and institutions in applying LLMs responsibly across diverse scientific contexts.

## 📚 Example from published research

The process was coordinated and overseen by a core team that prepared the initial draft of the checklist, incorporated feedback across both Delphi rounds, and guided the final consolidation of items. Core members included Christopher Barrie, M.J. Crockett, Stefan Feuerriegel, Laura K. Globig, Killian L. McLoughlin, Dan-Mircea Mirea, Manoel Horta Ribeiro, Steve Rathje, Arthur Spirling, and Diyi Yang. Their role was to synthesize the panel’s quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback, ensure methodological rigor throughout the preregistered process, and draft the manuscript.
