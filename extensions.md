# Extensions

The GUIDE-LLM checklist is designed to be broadly applicable across behavioral and social science research. In most cases, the core items will be relevant regardless of whether LLMs are used for text analysis, stimulus generation, simulated experiments, or participant-facing interventions. At the same time, we recognize that some subfields such as political science, economics, management, psychology, etc, may benefit from tailored extensions that address domain-specific needs or ethical considerations.  

We welcome such adaptations. If you are developing a field-specific extension, or would like advice on how to adapt GUIDE-LLM for your area, please contact us. GUIDE-LLM is a living framework, and we aim to support consistent, responsible reporting across disciplines.
