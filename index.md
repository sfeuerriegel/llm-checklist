# GUIDE-LLM: Reporting checklist for studies with large language models in the behavioral and social sciences

Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to study human behavior, yet their rapidly evolving nature poses challenges for research rigor. **GUIDE-LLM** provides a consensus-based reporting checklist to improve transparency, reproducibility, and ethical accountability across behavioral and social science research. In particular, **GUIDE-LLM** supports researchers in clearly describing **how** LLMs were used, **why** specific methodological choices were made, and **what** steps were taken to ensure responsible research practices.
