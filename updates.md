# Updates

GUIDE-LLM is maintained as a **living document**, that evolves with advances in large language model (LLLM) research and LLM applications across the behavioral and social sciences. We recognize that best practices, technical standards, and methodological challenges shift quickly in this domain; therefore, the checklist is designed to adapt as new evidence, tools, and community feedback emerge.  


To ensure the checklist remains accurate and relevant, we plan to incorporate **updates using a structured revision strategy**: 
- Minor updates (e.g., such as clarifications, wording adjustments, or additional examples) are reviewed periodically by the core team. 
- Major updates (e.g., such as adding, removing, or redefining checklist items) occur on a fixed review cycle and involve a formal vote within the core team.
-  Substantial conceptual revisions may trigger a renewed consensus process, such as a second Delphi study, to ensure broad expert input.

We welcome community suggestions for improvements, clarifications, or extensions to GUIDE-LLM. Researchers may propose **feedback** by contacting us directly via email at [feuerriegel@lmu.de](mailto:feuerriegel@lmu.de). Your feedback helps ensure that GUIDE-LLM remains a practical, transparent, and community-driven resource for strengthening rigor in LLM-based research.
